👋 Hi! I’m Rakesh Sharma, a ML & AI enthusiast driven by the potential of data to solve real-world challenges. My primary focus is on building intelligent models using Python, Tensor Flow, Scikit-Learn, and other cutting-edge tools to extract valuable insights and create impactful solutions.

🚀 While my journey began in Web Development, my passion has shifted toward applying analytical techniques and AI to tackle complex problems. Though I still enjoy crafting seamless web applications, my expertise now lies in using data to inform decisions, predict trends, and automate processes through machine learning.

💡 I’m always on the lookout for innovative projects and opportunities to apply my skills in Data Science and AI. Whether it’s developing predictive models, optimizing algorithms, or experimenting with deep learning, I’m dedicated to continuous learning and impactful results.

🤝 Let’s connect! Whether you’re looking for a collaborator on your next web project or someone to discuss the latest in Data Science, I’m excited to hear from you. Let’s create something amazing together.

```python
class DataScientist:

    def __init__(self):
        self.name = "Rakesh Sharma"
        self.role = "Data Scientist"
        self.language_spoken = ["en_US", "hi_IN", "or_IN"]
        self.link = "https://linktr.ee/TheRakeshSharma"

    def say_hi(self):
        print(f"Hi, I'm {self.name}, a {self.role}. Thanks for dropping by😊")
        print(f"Checkout: {self.link}")

me = DataScientist()
me.say_hi()
